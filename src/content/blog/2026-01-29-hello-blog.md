# Initial Blog Post

I'm starting a weekly blog to share what I'm building, learning, and exploring. 

This page tests all the functionalites that may be used in the future.

## Markdown + Math

Inline math like $E = mc^2$ works, and so do display blocks:

$$
\int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} \, dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}
$$

## Code snippet

```ts
type Post = {
  title: string;
  date: string;
};
```

## What's next

- Learning journal
- Short project updates
- Helpful links and resources
