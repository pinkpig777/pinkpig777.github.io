# Hello, Weekly Blog

I'm starting a weekly blog to share what I'm building, learning, and exploring.

## Why GitHub Pages

It's simple, free, and fast. I can write Markdown, commit, and deploy without a database.

## What's next

- Short project updates
- Notes on engineering and design
- Helpful links and resources
